## Quality Enhancement Tags

Always include relevant quality tags:
- `high quality`, `detailed`, `professional`
- `8K resolution`, `sharp focus`, `crisp details`
- `masterful composition`, `expert lighting`

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-prompting** - Too many details can confuse the model
2. **Conflicting styles** - Don't mix "photorealistic" with "painterly"
3. **Unrealistic combinations** - Keep physics and logic consistent
4. **Missing atmosphere** - Always include mood/lighting descriptors
5. **Ignoring aspect ratio** - Compose for your target format

## Consistency Tips

For character/subject consistency across scenes:
1. Use the same descriptive terms for recurring elements
2. Specify consistent lighting direction
3. Maintain color palette references
4. Use seed values when available

## Text in Images

Nano Banana Pro excels at text rendering:
```
Sign reading "[exact text]" in [font style], [material/surface],
[lighting on sign], legible clear typography
```

**Example:**
```
Vintage wooden sign reading "Books & Brews" in hand-painted serif font,
weathered wood texture, warm backlit glow, clear legible typography,
decorative coffee cup and open book icons
```
